I. SOME FUNDAMENTALS
"For Paul, Some fundamentals." That is how Albert Murray inscribed my copy of Stomping the Blues. Here is one of his most fundamental points: "You don't stomp the blues like this [pounds fist on table]—you stomp the blues like this [snaps with pa- nache on the afterbeat]." Murray used this example all the time in interviews and on panels in order to illustrate that the blues is "stomped" with elegance, not force; with technique, not power; with joie de vivre, not rage.
The jacket copy of the first edition of this book, which Murray probably was involved with, paraphrases the book's controlling idea: "Bessie Smith owes far more to MaRainey than to hard luck,
just as Charlie Parker owes far more to his years of apprenticeship in all-night Kansas City jam sessions than to his later sufferings. If this interpretation seems unromantic, then Murray creates for us his own much sturdier myth. Blues music, he tells us, has al- ways been good-time music; its function has been the exorcism of despair." Toan extent, this is an application of Andre Malraux's argument about the workings of the artistic process: that art, pri- marily, is a response to art, as explained in his book The Voices of Silence (1953), a monumental, profound, and idiosyncratic analysis of the visual arts that Murray studied for decades, and a work not unlike Stomping the Blues in several ways: poetic, written by a learned critic, yet not shackled by the conventions
developed or expected by academic or journalistic critics of the form in question, slow and methodical to start, and difficult to put down once it starts swinging. Another point Murray considered fundamental was his reorientation of how blues relates to jazz: as a matter of the level of orchestration. Indeed, he argues that the process by which pop tunes and show tunes are recomposed as jazz tunes is "precisely" the process by which the folk blues was extended, elaborated, and refined into jazz. Stomping the Blues is fundamental to his vision of existence and a lens through which to view other aspects of culture.
Stomping the Blues is about facing the void with—and through— style. Style and elegance, for Murray, are the basis of a heroic response to entropy. Written when Murray was in his late fifties and published when he was sixty, it is the product of long study and observation on both life and music. Like other books Murray studied, including Constance Rourke's American Humor (1931), Ernest Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon (1932, on bullfight- ing), A. J. Liebling's The Sweet Science (1949, on boxing), and even Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler (1653), Stomping the Blues is a writer's literary treatise on a subject in which he de- veloped expertise, but it is also more than that. It expounds a vision of and for life. Like those other works, Stomping the Blues endures year after year, enthralling readers new and old whilepro- voking debate.
In Murray's memoir South to a Very Old Place (1971), he writes of approaching the recently desegregated south through his "lit- erary radar" and "metaphor finder." Stomping the Blues is also written in that literary spirit. It is neither strictly historical nor musicological, though it is informed by both disciplines. It bears witness to a world and a set of feelings about that world as it corrects the record and offers a new frame of reference for under- standing American music. It will be shelved in a music collection, close to such classic and comprehensive musicological histories as Gunther Schuller's The Swing Era and Eileen Southern's The Music of Black Americans, but it could also be shelved under belles-lettres.
Stomping the Blues would also have a proper place on a shelf of "modernity studies," near titles such as Roberto Calasso's La Folie Baudelaire, or Walter Benjamin's The Arcades Project, or
Mark Greif s The Age of the Crisis of Man—books very different from one another yet all thinking hard about responses to moder- nity. For Murray, black Americans had never been anywhere but on the vanguard of modernity and as such had developed sophis- ticated responses to it. In The Omni-Americans Murray writes, "someday students of machine-age culture in the United States may find that Negro slaves in the cotton field had already begun confronting and evolving esthetic solutions for the problems of assembly line regimentation, depersonalization, and collectiviza- tion." Later in The Omni-Americanshe writes of the blues tradition specifically: It is the product of the most complicated culture, and
therefore the most complicated sensibility in the modern world.
Black Americans' musical response to the railroad, whichMur- ray explores in detail in Stomping the Blues (guitars, harmonicas, drums, pianos, and horns create onomatopoeic representations of train sounds—the rhythm section can suggest the wheels, the horns can approximate the whistle, the piano can evoke the bell), is a playful response to technology that became the soundtrack for good times. It became part of the "equipment for living" of several generations (to borrow Kenneth Burke's phrase, which Murray often used). For more, see an outstanding academic study that Stomping the Blues inspired, Joel Dinerstein's book Swing- ing the Machine: Modernity, Technology, and African American Culture between the World Wars (2003), which Murray was inter- viewed for and which he admired.
Stomping the Blues was published by McGraw-Hill in Novem- ber 1976 and was celebrated with a midday "Kansas City Jam Session" in the publisher's landmark headquarters in midtown Manhattan, featuring jazz giants Mary Lou Williams, Budd John- son, Buck Clayton, Eddie Durham, Oliver Jackson, Bill Pember- ton, and Doc Cheatham. What an auspicious beginning: an art- ist saluted by artists he salutes. Stomping the Blues went on to win ASCAP's Deems Taylor Award for music criticism in 1977. A British edition was published in 1978, and subsequent American editions in 1982, 1989, and 2000. In 2016 it was included in the Library of America's edition of Murray's essays and memoirs, but without its extensive art program and thus without most of the captions, some of which are like mini-essays. Stomping the Blues originated as an essay without accompanying images, and while
the images complement the text, they are never keyed to the text. (Murray approved an Italian translation without images that was published in 1999.) I recommend the annotations to the Library of America edition (on pages 995-99), which I cowrote, to those interested in the sources for quotations that Murray does not cite. This fortieth anniversary edition replicates the art layout from the first edition, but follows the text of the Library of America edition, which was corrected for typographical errors.
This edition is a result of a collaboration that began in mid- 2009 when I pitched what became Rifftide: The Life and Opinions of Papa Jo Jones (2011), as told to Albert Murray, to the Univer- sity of Minnesota Press. Since then, working with Murray's liter- aryexecutor,LewisP.JonesIII,Minnesotahaspublished Murray Talks Music: Albert Murray on Blues and Jazz (2016), a collec- tion of Murray's previously uncollected or unpublished interviews and writings on music (edited by me), and a new edition of Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie as told to Al- bert Murray (2016), the fourth American edition. Murray Talks Music is a valuable companion to Stomping the Blues. These four books together tell an edifying story about American music and culture in the twentieth century: jazz and the blues as thought and lived;jazz and the blues in theory and practice. Stomping the Blues is the masterpiece that led to the other three. Stomping the Blues was probably one of the books by Murray that Basie "dipped into" (Murray'sphrase) when deciding whether to hire Murray as his as-told-to author. Jo Jones said to Murray: "Awardsand stuff: I don't keep this junk. Only your book [Stomping the Blues]: I keep that."

II. PUBLICATION HISTORY: AN OMNI-AMERICAN COLLABORATION
In the "Note on the Texts" in the Library of America edition of Murray's work there are three paragraphs explaining the publica- tion history of Stomping the Blues. As coeditor of that volume, I cowrote the scholarly apparatus, which includes the "Note on the Texts." The section on Stomping the Blues in the "Note" includes distillations of interviews I conducted with the book's "produc- er and art director," Harris Lewine, and Joyce Johnson, the edi-tor who acquired it. I will expand on that section of "Note on the Texts" here.
Murray's memoir South to a Very Old Place was a critical suc- cess. Joyce Johnson of McGraw-Hill (who would go on to be- come a prominent author) offered Murray a contract for it when it was ostensibly still a 64,000-word article for the "Going Home in America" series of Harper's Magazine, commissioned in early
1969 by Harper's editor-in-chief, Willie Morris. The trip through the South described in the book occurred in May 1969. By that autumn, Murray and Johnson were in discussions about book rights. According to Murray's calendar, he had lunch with John- son in the Russian Tea Room in NewYork on October 6, 1969. On January 19, 1970, Murray met with Johnson and her boss, Frank Taylor, in the McGraw-Hill headquarters. The contract seems to have been finalized by then.
Johnson had published books by Murray's friends and acquain- tances, including Seymour Krim and Harold Cruse (another au- thor republished by Minnesota), and may have gotten in touch with Murray through one of them. Prior to the publication of Mur- ray's first book, The Omni-Americans, in the spring of 1970, she had recognized him as an important new voice from his essays and reviews that had been appearing in the mid to late 1960s. She recalled that Cruse in particular had recommended Murray's work. (The Omni-Americans was published by the small startup firm Outerbridge and Dienstfrey, founded by two young guys who had worked at the Center for Urban Education, for whichMur- ray consulted in the late 1960s. The firm did not last long, but South to a Very Old Place probably would not have been right for its list.)
Harper's had commissioned South to a Very Old Place but de- clined to publish it, as Willie Morris had left the magazine by the time Murray finished writing it. Johnson published it anyway,and it went on to be a finalist for the National Book Award in the arts and letters category in 1972. Johnson then offered Murray a two- book contract: for his first novel, Train Whistle Guitar (which he had been trying to publish since 1952), and for an "Untitled Book on Africa." Train Whistle Guitar was published in May 1974. He never started the Africa book (or at least he didn't save any drafts) and instead submitted what became Stomping the Blues to fulfill
the contract. The manuscript was submitted to Johnson in the early spring of 1975.
Why did Murray decide to abandon the notion of a book on Africa and instead write Stomping the Blues? I do not know for sure, but perhaps it had something to do with the declining fortunes of jazz in general and Duke Ellington's declining health in particular. In an interview published in late April 1974, a month before Elling- ton's death, Murray said that "The Bluesfor Background [a work- ing title] . . . will be a history of the idiom and ritual of the blues." Perhaps Murray sensed a world was quickly slipping away, which Ellington's imminent death would have made stark. He added that "[A]n art form does give you the soul and spirit of a people and I'm trying to come up with a literary equivalent of that communionof souls . . . a literary equivalent of the blues with which I grew up." In the Afterword to Rifftide, Phil Schaap writes that for Jo Jones (with whom Murray talked frequently), pessimism about jazz's future was building in the late 1960s and became more intense following the death of Coleman Hawkins on May 19, 1969. Louis Armstrong died in 1971. Schaap adds, "At jazz's economic nadir, a smallish revival occurred, and with it came an unprecedented rev- erence for the music and its Afro-American roots." Murray wrote Stomping the Blues during jazz's nadir and caught the wave of its revival.
It is not the case that Murray thought that previous writers had nothing valuable to say about jazz. He admired the work of Martin Williams, whom he knew well; they collaborated on Smithsonian programs. Murray helped to bring the jazz criticism of Roger Pry- or Dodge back into print. He thought Andre Hodeir was worth reading. He admired William Bolitho's essay on the saxophone, "The Sound of the Zeitgeist" (1924). Williams,Dodge, Hodeir, and Bolitho were white. It's not the case that Stomping the Blues is a correction to a tradition of white jazz writing. But Murray did feel that there was a lot of worthless, not to mention pernicious, writ- ing out there about jazz (such as the work of WhitneyBalliett), especially about the blues. On a photocopy of Theodor Adorno's essay "Perennial Fashion—Jazz," Murray underlined the follow- ing by that famous non-fan of jazz: "Winthrop Sergeant, interna- tionally known today as the art editor of Life magazine, is responsible for the best, most reliable, and most sensible book on the
subject [jazz]/5 At the bottom of the page Murray wrote, "So much for Adornor Adorno, Murraybelieved, had derived his knowledge of the subject, at least partially, from a bad source. Murray was going to try to prevent mistakes like that in the future by offering a better source.
Joyce Johnson had been LeRoiJones's editor at William Mor- row in 1963 and had published his widely discussed book Blues People: Negro Music in White America. It was the first book she had ever acquired, and it was also the first book on jazz published by a black writer (and a book Murray did not care for).Johnson knew about jazz and the blues and knew the market for such books. 1976 was a great year for words about jazz accompanied by images, as art book publisher Harry N. Abrams published the magnificent Jazz People, a history of jazz by Murray's close friend Dan Morgenstern, with photographs by Ole Brask. There must have been something in the air. Jazz People and Stomping the Blues complement one another nicely and were often reviewed alongside one another (as in the New York Times Book Review and the daily New York Times).
Johnson told me that McGraw-Hill's profit center was its text- book business, and it regarded its trade book operation as its store window. As such, she had a lot of editorial independence, which she tried to exercise as best she could by publishing books that she hoped would foster interracial understanding. Inspired by living in Greenwich Village in the early 1960s, she was commit- ted to the civil rights movement and to the study of black Ameri- can achievements. She recognized the depth of Murray's insights, but she also worried that the weighty and relatively short trea- tise might not find the audience it deserved. She needed nocon- vincing as to the importance of the essay that became Stomping the Blues, but since McGraw-Hill had plenty of money, wanted to make more, and essentially gave her free rein, she decided to look into framing the essay with images.
Johnson recruited Harris Lewine, a former art director at McGraw-Hill (brought back on a freelance basis) and a fellow jazz buff. He is credited on the original title page as the book's pro- ducer and art director. He is partially responsible for the book's success and its enduring appeal—and without him, Murraywould not have written those brilliant captions. Some of the captions
contain important statements he does not make elsewhere, such as those about Charlie Parker and John Coltrane. In other in- stances the captions allowed him to riff on ideas that he might not have found a place for elsewhere, such as the connections between jazz and baseball.
Lewine and Murray crossed paths briefly in 1971 when Lewine designed the layout of South to a Very Old Place. They met once around that time but hadn't kept in touch. Shortly after, Lewine left McGraw-Hill for Warner Books. Lewine was a legend in his field, but he was also a maverick. The equally legendary book
jacket designer Louise Fili said of him in a magazine interview: "He had the distinction of having been fired from every job posi- tion [sic] he had ever held. With his encyclopedic grasp of design history, he taught me the importance of using historical reference as inspiration." Lewine told me his frequent movement within the industry resulted from not being able to abide criticism of his de- signs from the editorial side.
I interviewed Lewine over the phone on four occasions in April 2016 when I was researching the "Note on the Texts" for the Li- brary of America edition. One of these conversations lasted more than two hours. (I thought about calling him again when I started working on this Introduction, in April 2017, but learned that he had died in December 2016.) He enjoyed talking about Murray and the old days. Nearly blind and living alone in Manhattan at age eighty-seven, he had a vast reservoir of names, dates, and anec- dotes that he was glad to share. He was sharp, quick witted, and bristling with energy. Gruff, wry, and funny, he must have been a formidable force in his day. I was able to imagine why and how he and Murray worked so well together.
After being assigned by Johnson to work with each other, Lew- ine and Murray quickly became friends. Their minds operated with similar intensity. (Murray never talked to me about Lewine, and I never thought to ask.) They were both southerners who knew a lot about jazz, the blues, and the work of William Faulkner. Raised on the Gulf Coast, these veterans, readers, listeners, and indepen- dent thinkers shared many tastes and an Omni-American sensi- bility. Murray (1916-2013) grew up just outside Mobile, Alabama. Lewine (1929-2016) was from "Texas and New Orleans." His fa- ther had been a close friend of Seymour Weiss, the NewOrleans
hotelier and political power broker who was part of Huey Long's inner circle. When Lewine served in the U.S. Coast Guard in or near NewOrleans, Weiss would cash his paychecks. Weiss had been one of Robert Penn Warren's sources for background infor- mation on Long, who was the inspiration for Willie Stark inWar- ren's classic novel All the King's Men (1947). Murray and Warren had met in the 1960s and were close friends by the 1970s. The Murray-Lewine collaboration was one of many connections in a small world.
But these two men also had distinct differences. For instance, Murray rejected psychoanalysis, and his understanding of the blues is central to that rejection (see Conversations with Albert Murray and Conjugations and Reiterations). Lewine's longtime "shrink" was Kurt Eissler, who had been the director of the Freud Archives ("You can read about him in Janet Malcolm's book," Lewine told me). Lewine and Norman Mailer were old friends, but Lewine didn't mind Murray's criticism of Mailer (in South to a Very Old Place). He knew Murray was right. This small world of people was a large world of ideas. Lewine told me that working with Murray was "the greatest honor of my career."
He also called it "a happy collaboration." Lewine selected all of the images for Stomping the Blues. When I asked if Murray had input, he said no, and added that Murray did not ask for any. "Al believed in me!" he said. If Murray had wanted to reject an item, Lewine said he would have removed it with no questions asked— after all, Murray had to write all of the captions. They were writ- ten to specifications mandated by Lewine, down to the exact char- acter count. He'd say, for instance, "make this caption six lines with twenty-eight characters per line." So much has been read into some of these captions, which were written under such rigid guidelines—as strict as a tweet, with no option for a subsequent statement.
Many of the photographs and all of the record labels came from Lewine's own collection. Numerous photographs—some of which appeared for the first time in Stomping the Blues—came from the massive archive of their mutual friend Frank Driggs (1930-2011), a music producer and historian, who also provided the cover photograph for Rifftide. Lewine, as executor of Driggs's estate, donated the archive to Jazz at Lincoln Center in 2013.
Lewine and Driggs collaborated on the book Black Beauty, White Heat: A Pictorial History of Classic Jazz, 1920-1950 (William Morrow, 1982).
No expense seems to have been spared in producing the first edition of Stomping the Blues, published to reflect the signifi- cance of Murray's words and to showcase the artifacts arranged by Lewine. It is heftier, with larger pages than subsequent paper- backs—sort of halfway toward a coffee table book, but not quite. Lewine disliked the coffee table book format because it required a table or a lectern and thus was not ideally suited to contempo- rary reading habits. (Hecredited Mailer with convincing him that the coffee table book size was unwieldyand unnecessary.) Part of Lewine's skill involved creating something like a mini-coffee table book. Gary Giddins, reviewing Stomping the Blues in New York magazine, called it "one of the best looking books I've seen," and he even mentions the binding and endpapers—aspects of a book not often discussed in book reviews. In terms of design and layout, its origins or its precursor can perhaps be glimpsed or traced to Lewine's Goodbye to All That (McGraw-Hill, 1970), about the heyday and decline of cigarette advertisements. Lewine was the author and art director of that book, which could be described as a Stomping the Blues of cigarette ads, in terms of its design. It could have been a coffee table book but is even smaller than Stomping the Blues and has a similar font and page layout. (If Goodbye to All That had nothing to do with the idea for and series arc of Mad Men, I'd be surprised.)
Most of the collaborative work, such as the editing of the cap- tions, was done over the phone, but Lewine recalled a few work- ing visits to each other's apartments. Lewine remembered Murray arriving by bicycle at his apartment at 67 Park Avenue and had a clear memory of Murray's apartment in Harlem. He recalled a long walk around Harlem in which they discussed the captions. Their conversations often covered topics far and wide. He said they kept in touch for ten or fifteen years, then drifted apart. Lewine saw Murray for the last time at Brooks Brothers in midtown in the late 1990s—a coincidental meeting in which they chatted for a few minutes. I found Lewine's phone number whileinventorying Murray's apartment in late 2015.
III. RECEPTION AND INFLUENCE
Stomping the Blues was reviewed extensively. Some of the smart- est and most perceptive reviews include those by Gary Giddins in New York, John Edgar Wideman in The American Poetry Review, Robert Fleming in Freedomways, Bob Blumenthal in The Bos- ton Phoenix, Stanley Dance in Jazz Journal, and Greil Marcus in Rolling Stone. An unsigned little notice in the Miami Herald gets so much right:
Well, it would be a wasteland were it not for the occasional oasis like Murray's latest. Typically for this knowledgeable stu- dent of blues, the writing here is nothing short of rich, an expan- sive, rolling style that is no small factor in Murray's successful advancement of his thesis. His current campaign—it amounts to a debunking, actually—is to rid the blues of decades of association with the suffering of the chain gang and instead ascribe to it its proper musical niche, that of a powerful good-times music, a mu- sic to be danced to.
Many reviewers understood and appreciated what Murray was try- ing to do. A few years later Nelson George argued in the Village Voice in 1982 that it should be brought back into print and it soon was. George notes, perceptively, "the marvel of Stomping is that Murray manages to be both analytically detached and emotionally involved—criticism's most difficult parlay."
By the early 1980s, and perhaps beginning with the review of the British edition in the Times Literary Supplement in 1978, a certain number of white jazz critics had started misinterpreting and exaggerating the caption on page 197, in which Murray refers to white jazz musicians as being part of the "third line." Third line does not mean third rate, as several critics have claimed or im- plied: it simply refers to a physical position in the old NewOrleans parades, which Murray then used as a metaphor for closeness to idiomatic sources. This is what Murray clarifies in much more detail in Murray Talks Music, on pages 119-21. My header note to the piece in Murray Talks Music explains the stubborn controver- sy in more depth.
After annoyance with the caption started to circulate, Lewine told me he had to endure the incessant complaints of sever- al white people in the jazz world who asked him how he could have worked on the book. (Lewine was also an accomplished de- signer of jazz album covers and multi-disc packages.) One sig- nificant exception, Lewine noted, was producer Orrin Keepnews, who admired Stomping the Blues. I do not have outside confir- mation for the claim, but it rings true, as Keepnews and Murray later worked together on a project. Peter Keepnews, Orrin's son, reviewed the book in Jazz Magazine and wrote: "For those who have read any of Murray's earlier books—or have had the privi- lege of attending one of his riveting, energetic lectures on jazz— this is the book that seemed inevitable, the work in which he lays out a whole new critical vocabulary for dealing intelligently and informatively with the music on its own terms." For those unfamiliar with Murray, Keepnews adds, it's "the discovery of the year."
Stomping the Blues was probably the first work to articulate the connection betweenjazz, the blues, and locomotive onomato- poeia (or at least the first to do so cogently and comprehensively). Duke Ellington had been orchestrating stylized locomotives since the 1920s and Murray had been talking with Ellington about this since at least 1951 (see Trading Twelves: The Selected Letters oj Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray). This orchestration can be heard in the music of Count Basie and many others as well. When new listeners recognize the stylized locomotive underlying much classic jazz, new vistas of appreciation open up. During a lively public discussion between scholars from around the country to- ward the end of a symposium on Murray's work at Columbia Uni- versity in 2016, a prominent musicologist questioned the valueof Murray's observations about percussion and locomotive onomato- poeia. A professor of American studies was quick to point out to him how revelatory Murray's writing on this topic was in the late 1970s and how valuable it has been subsequently. Murray's ideas have diffused so thoroughly that their origin and impact are not always clear.
Stomping the Blues had a marked influence on the development of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which Murray cofounded (see Murray Talks Music). The Preface to the Da Capo Press edition in 2000 frames the book in terms of that influence; it is the only previous edition to have an introductory essay. The Preface was written by Rob Gibson, a performing arts executive who was the first direc- tor of Jazz at Lincoln Center in 1991, and in 2000 was its exec- utive producer and director. Gibson first encountered the book while working in college radio in Atlanta in the late 1970s. He writes that his college jazz radio cohort "thought Albert Murray was some sort of sage, sent to clarify the essence of our mission for the airwaves." As of 2000, he writes that Stomping the Blues is a "preeminent source" for people working in the jazz world and that Jazz at Lincoln Center has been able to embody "the many ideas that define this treatise."
Aside from its place in the intellectual foundation of Jazz at Lincoln Center, Stomping the Blues has become a standard text in history of jazz courses, is a foundational text of the discipline of jazz studies, and has been quoted, cited, and discussed in doz- ens of books and academic articles. One of these, "A Blue Note on Black American Literary Criticism and the Blues" (Amerika- studien/American Studies 55, no. 4 [2010]) by Jeffrey B. Ferguson is a complex consideration of how the blues is perceived today and has been perceived since the civil rights movement (when, Ferguson argues persuasively, it lost influence). Ferguson's read- ing of Stomping the Blues is appreciative and nuanced, but he asks where the blues fits into contemporary life in the twenty- first century (and thus he argues that the blues is overempha-
sized in contemporary literary criticism). I've been pondering this article for years (especially while working on my dissertation in 2013-14), and I understand Ferguson's point: most people today do not think in terms of the blues. Whether or not blues music is signifying at blue feelings is not something that crosses most people's minds.
But the reason to read Stomping the Blues today is not neces- sarily for its influence on Jazz at Lincoln Center, or on jazz stud- ies as a discipline, or because the blues is central to the life of a random person on the street, or can elucidate a crucial response to modernity, but because following the movement of Murray's thought is a valuable experience in itself. This is why people still read, say, Urne-Buriall (1658)—for Sir Thomas Browne's prose and the workings of his mind, not for its content. Yetthe content of Stomping the Blues is accurate and can be the cornerstone of
an education in twentieth-century music. And, as a sort of bonus, Murray's prose "sparks like a live wire" (Fleming) and "it swings so hard you may be moved to read passages aloud" (Giddins). So, if you're buying this book to replace a tattered copy from a history of jazz course, or if you are completing a Murray collection, or if you are discovering Murray for the first time, may it be your dis- covery of the year, and may rediscoveries be like new discoveries. Happy stomping.

The Blues as Such.

Sometimes you forget all about them in spite of yourself, \but all too often the very first thing you realize when you wake up is that they are there again, settling in like bad weather, hovering like plague-bearing insects, swarming precisely
as if they were indeed blue demons dispatched on their mission of harassment by none other than the Chief Red Devil of all devils himself; and yet perhaps as often as not it is also as if they squat obscene and vulturelike, waiting and watching you and preening themselves at the same time, their long rubbery necks writhing as if floating.
Not that they are ever actually seen. They are always said to be blue, even as common-variety ghosts are always said to be at least somewhat gray. But being absolutely insubstantial, they are in fact completely invisible for all that everybody seems to have the dis- tinct impression that they are always very small and not only plural but so numerous as to be numberless.
Still even as they are represented as teeming, swarming, and writhing nobody ever describes how they actually look. Because they have no image. Thus they do not appear and disappear. They are there because they have already come, and they linger some- what as if clinging with tentacles, and they go, mostly when driven. But never soon enough. Nor do they ever seem to go far enough away even so. Once they have been there they only shift from the foreground to the background, and maybe you forget about them for the time being, but only for the time being.
All anybody ever presumes to describe with any precision is how ^ouaTe ^efy *°^ee'whentheyarepresent.Youbecome afflicted as if infected by some miasma-generatingmicrobe. You feel down- hearted and uncertain. You are woebegone and anxiety-ridden. So much so that you would think that their characteristiccoloration would be something suggesting the grayness of low-hanging clouds rather than blue. But in truth nobody ever seems to give that matter any thought at all, and there is even less concern about which specific shade of blue is involved. At the same time, how- ever, nobody ever confuses anything about their behavior with the silky blueness of high and cloudless skies either.
They are also absolutely noiseless at all times. Their movements make no sound whatsoever. And they are evidently voiceless. They are said to speak, but only in the silent language of spirits. So even when they are quoted as if verbatim, you know the speaker is paraphrasing, because the accent and tone and even the volume and timbre are always very obvious stylizations of a voice all too obviously his own. Moreover, no matter how concrete the refer- ences, you already know very well that the statement is meant only to be taken as allegorical. (Item: When Jimmy Rushing sings, "Good morning, blues. Blues how do you do? Blues say, 7 feel all right but I come to worry you,'" the reply is given as if literal but not only is the voice still Rushing's, there is also no confusion at all when the singular I is used instead of the plural we.)
Nor do they ever seem to shock and terrify as some specters sometimes do (as often by simply vanishing and reappearing and vanishing into thin air again as by popping into uncertain view from nowhere in the first place). You know they are there only because you feel their presence in the atmosphere once more as
you did the time before and the time before that; because every- thing, which is to say time itself, has somehow become heavy with vague but dire and disconcerting forebodings of impending frustra- tion leading perhaps to ultimate doom. So sometimes at first it is as if you yourself have been draped with a leaden invisible net. Then you realize that you don't feel so good anymore, not because all at once you have been stricken but because a dull and unspecific ache is beginning to throb. Then sometimes you feel yourself be- coming rueful, or glum, or sometimes either sullen, mean, and downright evil on the one hand or weak in the stomach and knees on the other.
